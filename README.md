🧠 I Build AI Systems That Actually Think — Not Just Respond.

I’m Kartikey Sharma, an AI Engineer focused on designing structured, production-grade LLM systems with real-world guardrails, validation layers, and scalable backend architectures.

I don’t just call APIs.
I design AI workflows that reason step-by-step, enforce structured outputs, and deploy reliably.

🔥 What I Do Differently

Architect multi-step LLM reasoning pipelines

Enforce strict JSON schema validation

Build guardrail-based AI systems

Reduce hallucinations using structured prompting

Deploy models using FastAPI + Docker

Convert messy business logic into automated AI workflows

🏗 My Engineering Philosophy

AI should be:

Deterministic where required

Structured, not chaotic

Validated before output

Production-ready, not demo-ready

Most people build prompts.
I build systems around prompts.
